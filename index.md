## About Me

![Lois Randolph](assets/images/Me.jpg)


Thank you for visiting my portfolio page! My name is Lois Randolph and I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio where I received my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Mathematics. I spent a gap year as a PREP (Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program) scholar at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, successfully finishing the year-long rigorous program that prepared me for graduate school. After completing my post-bac program, I was later accepted into the UT Health SA Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences where I earned my M.S. in Cancer Biology. During my time in graduate school, I served as the Advocacy Chair for UTHSCSA PRIDE and vice president for ALLIES, volunteering at clinical events that raise awareness to queer youth having access to healthcare, mental health resources, educational development programs, and hosting multiple student-led social events.


I'm a biologist by training but a programmer at heart, with a deep passion for precision medicine, computational biology, data science, machine learning, AI, and data engineering. I'm primarily self-taught in R, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and Linux. I enjoy the challenges presented to me that involve, building prediction models to identify biomarkers to improve medical treatments, manage tools & databases used by teams, institutions, and companies for data storage, data processing, and quality control, and developing pipelines that can automate tasks improving work efficiency. Though this is a different career path I was not expecting, I believe that "where there is passion and inspiration, you can't go wrong".

## Experience

### Bioinformatics Researcher
**UT Health San Antonio · 2023–Present**

- Lead the development of early diagnostic and prognostic models for neonatal and pediatric care to identify risk of disease onset and clinical outcomes.  
- Integrated heterogeneous datasets including EMR, bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, methylation, microbiome, proteomics, and other omics or clinical data.  
- Developed and applied statistical models ranging from simple linear regressions to mixed-effects frameworks on both static and longitudinal datasets, rigorously controlling for covariates and batch effects.  
- Engineered reproducible, containerized workflows leveraging parallel processing to optimize data handling, multicohort meta-analyses, and regression and classification tasks, improving computational efficiency ~50% and enabling systematic model comparison.
- Designed unsupervised machine learning workflows to identify patient subgroups across diverse datasets.  
- Refined single-cell type annotations and integrated single-cell with spatial transcriptomics for high-resolution tissue maps.  
- Implemented version-controlled workflows using Git to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.  
- Supported clinical decision-making by translating complex molecular and clinical data into actionable insights for risk assessment and patient stratification.  


### Graduate Research Assistant
**UT Health San Antonio · 2021–2023**

- Cancer transcriptomics and DE analysis
- Publication-ready QC and figures
- Reproducible R workflows

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
